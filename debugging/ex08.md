Password (5:57 mins)
The following code prompts the user to set their own password if they haven't done so already, and then prompts them to login with that password. However, the program throws an error. What is the problem and how can you fix it?

Once you get the program to run without error, does it behave as expected? Verify that you are able to log in with your new password.


password = nil

def set_password
  puts 'What would you like your password to be?'
  new_password = gets.chomp
  password = new_password
end

def verify_password(password)
  puts '** Login **'
  print 'Password: '
  input = gets.chomp

  if input == password
    puts 'Welcome to the inside!'
  else
    puts 'Authentication failed.'
  end
end

if !password
  password = set_password
end

verify_password(password)

On line 28, within the `if` conditional statement, the `set_password` method is called allowing you to type in a password as expected; however, the password entered and returned from the method is never assigned to a variable. `password` remains set to `nil`. Reassigning `password` to the return value corrects this issue.

The second issue on line 31 is that the `verify_password` method does not pass in `password` to use the equality comparison on line 20 within the method. Adding the required parameter and passing it into the method corrects the issue.
