Number Guessing Game
A friend of yours wrote a number guessing game. The first version he shows you picks a random number between 1 and a provided maximum number and offers you a given number of attempts to guess it.

However, when you try it, you notice that it's not working as expected. Run the code and observe its behavior. Can you figure out what is wrong?


def valid_integer?(string)
  string.to_i.to_s == string
end

def guess_number(max_number, max_attempts)
  winning_number = (1..max_number).to_a.sample
  attempts = 0

  loop do
    attempts += 1
    break if attempts > max_attempts

    input = nil
    until valid_integer?(input)
      print 'Make a guess: '
      input = gets.chomp
    end

    guess = input.to_i

    if guess == winning_number
      puts 'Yes! You win.'
###     ### Missed a break here
    else
      puts 'Nope. Too small.' if guess < winning_number
      puts 'Nope. Too big.'   if guess > winning_number

      # Try again:
###      #guess_number(max_number, max_attempts) * Removed this line correctly*
    end
  end
end

guess_number(10, 3)

On line 34, the 'try again' logic re-calls the method again each time a wrong number is guessed. The game never ends unless you guess the number correctly on the first try.
