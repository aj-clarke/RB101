Reverse Sentence (8 mins)
The reverse_sentence method should return a new string with the words of its argument in reverse order, without using any of Ruby's built-in reverse methods. However, the code below raises an error. Change it so that it behaves as expected.

def reverse_sentence(sentence)
  words = sentence.split(' ')
  reversed_words = []

  i = 0
  while i < words.length
    reversed_words = words[i] + reversed_words
    i += 1
  end

  reversed_words.join(' ')
end

p reverse_sentence('how are you doing')
# expected output: 'doing you are how'

On line 10, we are attempting to add an string array element and an array object together, and the array object cannot be converted to a string to be added together.
Using the `unshift` method, we can add each word to the array at index position 0 to reverse the string.

Here is the code:
def reverse_sentence(sentence)
  words = sentence.split(' ')
  reversed_words = []

  i = 0
  while i < words.length
    reversed_words.unshift(words[i]) # <----- Changed
    i += 1
  end

  reversed_words.join(' ')
end
