Getting Things Done (9:30 mins)

We wrote a method for moving a given number of elements from one array to another. We decide to test it on our todo list, but invoking move on line 11 results in a SystemStackError. What does this error mean and why does it happen?


def move(n, from_array, to_array)
  to_array << from_array.shift
  move(n - 1, from_array, to_array) if n > 1
end

# Example

todo = ['study', 'walk the dog', 'coffee with Tom']
done = ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach']

move(2, todo, done)

p todo # should be: ['coffee with Tom']
p done # should be: ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach', 'study', 'walk the dog']

This error means that there is an infinite amount of calls added to the stack since the move method is called continuously without any conditional to stop it causing a stack overflow. Adding the `if` conditional on line 8 to control when the call to `move` stops corrected the issue.
