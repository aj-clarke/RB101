=begin

Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen.
If we had a table of Flintstone family memebers that was fourty characters in
width, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?

=end

title = 'Flintstones Family Members'

puts title.center(40)
