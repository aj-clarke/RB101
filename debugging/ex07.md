Neutralizer (9:38 mins)
We wrote a neutralize method that removes negative words from sentences. However, it fails to remove all of them. What exactly happens?


def neutralize(sentence)
  words = sentence.split(' ')
  words = words.select do |word|
    !negative?(word)
  end

  words.join(' ')
end

def negative?(word)
  [ 'dull',
    'boring',
    'annoying',
    'chaotic'
  ].include?(word)
end

puts neutralize('These dull boring cards are part of a chaotic board game.')
# Expected: These cards are part of a board game.
# Actual: These boring cards are part of a board game.

When you iterate through an array and remove an element, it shifts the entire index of elements, therefore causing an element to get skipped on the following iteration (`boring` in this case). When `dull` was deleted (index position 1 originally) and the `each` method was iterating to index position 2, `boring` was not there, it was shifted to index position 1 causing this bug.
Altered the code to use the `select` method instead with the block returning the word if it is not within the `negative?` methods array.
