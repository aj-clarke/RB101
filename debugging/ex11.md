What's wrong with the output?
Josh wants to print an array of numeric strings in reverse numerical order. However, the output is wrong. Without removing any code, help Josh get the expected output.


arr = ["9", "8", "7", "10", "11"]
p arr.sort do |x, y|
    y.to_i <=> x.to_i
  end

# Expected output: ["11", "10", "9", "8", "7"]
# Actual output: ["10", "11", "7", "8", "9"]


# ------------------- FIX -------------------
p(
  arr.sort do |x, y|
    y.to_i <=> x.to_i
  end
)

or 

p arr.sort { |x, y| y.to_i <=> x.to_i }

The main reason why the output was unexpected is because when you use do...end
block, p and arr.sort bind more tightly due to Ruby's precedence rules, so you
are passing the block to the return value of p arr.sort. It's as though you wrote:

(p arr.sort) do |x,y|
  y.to_i <=> x.to_i
end
